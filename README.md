Abstract

An Intelligent System for Verifying Claims and Detecting AI-Generated Content

Problem Statement :

Since social media has become a part of all our lives. Over 5.2 billion people use platforms like Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Social media is a great platform for people to connect, discuss and share opinions. But it has also become a way to spread misinformation, publish unverified facts and blind users subconsciously with AI-generated videos disguised as real content. Users often cannot distinguish between authentic and synthetic media or verify the factual accuracy of viral posts. Currently, platforms do not possess any moderation systems and fact-checking tools are limited, reactive, and rarely accessible to individual users. This erodes trust, spreads false information rapidly, and exposes brands, creators, and audiences to reputation and ethical risks.

Proposed Solution :

A browser-based platform that flags AI generated content with automated fact-checking to combat misinformation. The system operates through four integrated components:

Media Authentication: Users can paste twitter posts links. The platform will extarct content and verify the claim using a machine learning model.

Claim Verification: Extracted claims are cross-referenced against trusted fact-checking APIs and databases this includes established fact-checking organizations (PolitiFact, Snopes, Reuters Fact Check) and recent news sources via news aggregation services. The platform uses AI-based reasoning to match claims against verified information and assess factual accuracy.

Result Presentation: Users receive a comprehensive authenticity report including an individual claim verdicts (True/False/Unverified) which directly links to source citations. This enables users to trace the origin of claims and understand the reasoning behind verdicts.

By automating detection and verification, this solution makes media literacy accessible to individual users while reducing the spread of misinformation across social platforms.

Expected Impact :

This solution doesn’t just fight misinformation but also reshapes how people think before they believe. By making fact-checking immediate, transparent, and user-friendly, it cultivates a habit of healthy skepticism. Instead of reflexively sharing something they see, they pause, question its authenticity, and verify before amplifying it. Over time this builds media-literate communities, strengthens collective trust, and reduces anxiety, confusion, polarization, or reputation harm. Beyond individuals, this solution empowers creators, brands, and organizations to engage with content responsibly. They can verify claims before publishing, protect their credibility, and contribute to a healthier information ecosystem.
